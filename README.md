Howdy!

Welcome to my random password generator! 

This application will serve as a way for a user to create a new password from randomly generated characters. 
The user will be able to select how many characters to include in their password from 8-128
The user will be able to also select if they wish to include uppercase and lowercase numbers; as well as special characters and numbers 0-9

This can be extremely userful for ensuring that the users passwords are secure. 
Truly secure passwords can be extremely difficult to think of on the spot, this application removes that process and replaces it with an easy to use solution. 
If the user does not like a generated password they can easily start over to get a new one.
